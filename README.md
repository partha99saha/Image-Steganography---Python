An image is represented as an N*M (in case of grayscale images) or N*M*3 (in case of color images) matrix in memory, with each entry representing the intensity value of a pixel. 
In image steganography, a message is embedded into an image by altering the values of some pixels, 
which are chosen by an encryption algorithm. The recipient of the image must be aware of the same algorithm in order to know which pixels he or she must select to extract the message
